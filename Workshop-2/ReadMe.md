# Workshop 2

## 1️. Introduction  
This section presents the main idea behind **BogoGo**, and an overview of the workshop.

## 2️. Canvas Business Model  
This section provides an overview of **BogoGo’s Business Model Canvas**, illustrating how the platform generates value and operates as a business.   
The diagram serves as a **strategic summary** of the project’s core operations and business logic.

## 3️. Requirements  
This section defines the **system requirements** that guide BogoGo’s design and development.  
It focuses on understanding user needs and translating them into functional specifications.

### 3.1 Functional Requirements (FR)  
Describe what the system **must do**, including actions users can perform.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)  
Explain **system qualities** such as performance, usability, scalability, and security.  
These are justified through theoretical principles and realistic time estimates to ensure feasibility and technical soundness.

## 4️. User Stories  
This section outlines the **user stories** derived from the requirements.  
Each story describes user interactions from the perspective of customers, vendors, or administrators — providing a **user-centered view** of the system’s features.

## 5️. Database Architecture  
This section details the **data architecture** supporting BogoGo’s core operations.  

### High-Level Architecture Overview  
This section briefly describes the architecture and its main entities. Additionally, it includes the corrected version of the entity-relationship diagram.

### Main components 
This section defines the main components, which are divided into layers. Each layer is presented along with a proposed technology and a justification for its selection.

### Data flow between layers
This section provides a brief explanation of how the data will flow through the main components, offering an overview of its movement within the system.

## 6. Information Requirements  
This section defines the **types of data** the system must be able to return in response to user actions or queries. It describes how users interact with system data, ensuring transparency and traceability.  
These outputs are linked to specific **user stories and requirements**, ensuring consistency between business needs and technical implementation.
## 7️. Query Proposals  
This section presents the **SQL queries** that retrieve key information from the database according to user requirements.  
## 8. Changes from Workshop 1
In this section, we present all the changes made to Workshop 1, taking into account the feedback received.
